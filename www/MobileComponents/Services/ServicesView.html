                <div class="panel-body">
                    Wet cleaning is a cleaning process utilized for treating sensitive textiles (e.g. wool, silk, rayon, & linen). Garments are cleaned in water by professionals using special technology, detergents, and additives to minimize the potential for adverse effects. It is followed by appropriate drying and restorative finishing procedures.

                    When you choose Kona Couture Care, your garments are cared for by the most highly skilled and trained staff members of our team. Each item is carefully inspected for the best care of cleaning and stain removal. All buttons, hems, embellishments and trims are inspected, reinforced or repaired if necessary. Your garments are then hand pressed by our most skilled garment finishers, who assert close attention to each and every detail. Once finished, your items are then inspected once again, to ensure they look perfect before they are beautifully packaged for you.
