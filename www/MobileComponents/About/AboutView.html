                    Kona Cleaners started in business back in 1950. It moved to it’s current location at 333 E 17th Street back in 1960. Kona Cleaners is family owned and operated by Bobby Patel, who has owned the store location since 1995. Since that purchase, Bobby has added 5 more locations in Orange County and Pick up and Delivery routes to service your homes directly. Bobby's background as an engineer developed his passion for technology. He believes that the more you automate the day to day drudgery of repeated movements, the more you will succeed.
