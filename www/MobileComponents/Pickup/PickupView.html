                        <li><span style="font-size: medium;">We provide you with two Kona Cleaners Garment bags with your account information on it.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: medium;">We set up your scheduled delivery days, either Monday/Thursday, or Tuesday/Friday, (Depending on where you live or work.)</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: medium;">We come by your home or office on the scheduled days to pick up, and return the clean garments from the previous pick up. If you do not have anything to send in that day, no worries, we'll come back again on the next scheduled day. We are in your neighborhood anyways.</span></li>
                        <li><span style="font-size: medium;">We automatically bill your credit card on file, so you dont need to be home to pay for services!</span></li>
